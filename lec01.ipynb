    "\n",
    "**Real-world Example:** \"Making a cup of lemon tea.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of thinking about the entire process at once, let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Boil Water:**\n",
    "    * Fill a kettle with water.\n",
    "    * Turn on the stove or plug in the electric kettle.\n",
    "    * Wait for the water to boil.\n",
    "2.  **Brew the Tea:**\n",
    "    * Put a tea bag in a cup.\n",
    "    * Pour the boiling water into the cup.\n",
    "    * Wait 3-5 minutes for the tea to steep.\n",
    "3.  **Add Flavor:**\n",
    "    * Cut a slice of lemon.\n",
    "    * Squeeze the lemon into the cup.\n",
    "    * Add sugar (if desired).\n",
    "4.  **Finish:**\n",
    "    * Stir everything together.\n",
    "    * Enjoy your tea.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:** By breaking down the task of \"making lemon tea,\" each step becomes very simple and easy to follow. It's the same in programming, where we break down a large program into smaller functions."
